# 💀ReaperLauncher
### A spooky minecraft launcher that has the best features that are easier to use than ever!

## 👋Our goals

with ReaperLauncher we aim to give a premium experince without the restrictions of the others! We add features such as a minimap, waypoints and Durability ping so you can have the best experince while playing minecraft while still retaining the customizability of your favorite mod loader.



## 🚘Roadmap

* Initalize project with microsoft and azure <- Current
* Create project base features in python and kivy
* Implement basic mod validity checks (and maybe a database for compatible mods?)
* Get feedback and tweak UI/UX
* Release 1.0.0! 🎊
* Open the project to contributors
* Decide next course of action/roadmap
### Remember, this project is in its earliest stages!

### 🛠️Dev notes
* This will be my first time interacting with Microsofts Azure, this is a learning experince not a full commercial product!
* This will never be monetized directly! im not going say there will never be merch or anything of the sort, but there will never be ads or transactions!
